## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use **__attribute__((unused))** or **(void)** to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

### HAPPY LEARNING :-)
